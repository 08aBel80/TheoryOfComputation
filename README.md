# TheoryOfComputation
little project I did in Theory Of Computation, one of the classes at my university.

short summary:
1. State class: my implementation of a generic state of any automatas, has some functions, that helped me to implement NFA class
2. NFA class: my implementation of an NFA automata, has 3 main functions union, star, concat, that help build more complex NFAs.The toString() function was implemented in a way that was necessary for my class assignment.
