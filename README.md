# TheoryOfComputation
little project I did in Theory Of Computation, one of the classes at my university.

short summary:
1. State class: my implementation of a generic state of any automatas, has some functions, that helped me to implement NFA class
2. NFA class: my implementation of a NFA automata, has 3 main functions union, star, concat, that help in building more complex NFAs. toString() function is implemented in a way that my assignment in class needed.
